To install Gimp# you will need Mono 2.8.x or higher. Gimp# will
work with GIMP 2.8. GIMP 2.6 (and lower) is not tested anymore.

Building Gimp# is easy:

1) unpack the archive
2) $ cd gimp-sharp-0.19
3) $ ./configure
4) $ make
5) become root
6) $ make install

If installing from git instead of from the package, do "autoreconf -i"
before "./configure". Otherwise the configure step will fail with
config.status: error: cannot find input file: `Makefile.in'

Note: configure has the option --with-unittest which will build the
UnitTest plug-in. --with-incomplete and --with-pdn will build
additional incomplete (yet) plug-ins.

The files will be installed in your GIMP plug-in directory, for
example in /usr/local/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/ (the path is not based on
the --prefix given to ./configure, but what gimptool-2.0 returns, in
order for GIMP to notice the plugins).


At the moment Gimp# will install 15 plug-ins for you:

/Filters/Picture Package
/Filters/Photoshop Actions
/Filters/Artistic/Ministeck
/Filters/Artistic/Pointillize
/Filters/Blur/Average
/Filters/Distorts/Fragment
/Filters/Light and Shadow/Raindrops
/Filters/Render/Forge
/Filters/Render/NCP
/Filters/Render/QR
/Filters/Render/Sky
/Filters/Render/Splitter
/Filters/Render/Swirlies
/Filters/Web/Slice Tool
/Image/Trim

You will also get plug-ins to read wbmp (wireless bitmap), GEM and
KoaloaPaint (old CBM64 format) files.

If you want to have jpeg2000 support (the ecw plug-in) you will have
to install the ecw jpeg 2000 SDK first (http://www.ermapper.com/ecw/).

If you want to build the Colorize plug-in you will have to install the 
UMFPACK library (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/) first.
